Easier to read MG top-down beam parsing
=======================================

This is a fork of Edward P. Stabler’s top-down beam parser for MG[+SpIC_mrg] that
aims to make the python3 implementation more readable and ’pythonesque’ -- more  
object-oriented, less in style of functional programming. This is part of effort to add
mgtdb as Kataja plugin.

There will be several versions in Python3 -folder, alphabetically from mgtdbA, which are more and more modified from the original. There is a verify.py for automated testing if two versions produce the same output.
